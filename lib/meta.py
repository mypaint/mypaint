"""GUI-independent project meta-information.

Version Strings
---------------

MyPaint uses `Semantic Versioning`_ for its version strings.

    ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-PREREL][+BUILD]``

As a result, prerelease phases are marked in the code itself.
The currently defined prerelease phases are:

Suffix "-alpha":
    Actually the active development cycle.
    If any "alpha release" tarballs are made in this phase,
    they will be informal snapshots only,
    made towards the end of the cycle.

Suffix "-beta" and a beta release number:
    The formal beta-testing cycle.
    No new features will be added in this phase, and
    only bugfixes will be accepted.

    User interface strings are frozen too,
    so that translators can get to work. This means that
    strings in the code can now only be patched
    to fix fundamental problems in their meanings.

Suffix "-rc":
    The formal release candidate cycle.

    Only critical bugfixes and string changes are allowed.

Empty string:
    The final release commit itself, _and only that commit_.

    A new alpha phase with an incremented ``MINOR``
    will start at the next commit.

The base version string may therefore look like:

  * "1.1.1-alpha"
  * "1.2.0-beta.0"
  * "1.2.0"

The release script expands the base version in the code
by appending a dot and the number of revisions committed
since the tag of the same name (with a "v" prefix).
This tag must exist in the source.

It uses this for versioning the release and any tarballs made:

  * "mypaint-2.4.7-beta.0.4.tar.bz2"
    - ad-hoc beta release four revisions after the "v2.4.7-beta.0" tag.
  * "2.4.7"
    - release 2.4.7 itself!

Whether you're building from a release tarball
or from a working git repository,
the build scripts also collect information about
when and where the build is taking place,
and from what release or git version.
They further append this build-level information to the version string,
in a way that makes it available at runtime.
This provides SemVer-style "+BUILD" notation
for display in the about box.
Some build suffixes and their meanings:

"+git.123abcd"
    Build was direct from a git repository,
    and was made at the specified commit.

"+gitexport.123abcd"
    Build was from an exported tarball,
    which was created at the specified commit.

"+git.123abcd.dirty"
    Build was direct from a git repository,
    which was created at the specified commit,
    but there were local uncommitted changes.

This build information is always present in the long about box version
number, but is never present in tarball names or other released
artifacts.
