    To improve application responsiveness, this mode uses an internal
    queue for capturing input data. The raw motion data from the stylus
    is queued; an idle routine then tidies up this data and feeds it
    onward. The presence of an input capture queue means that long
    queued strokes can be terminated by entering a new mode, or by
    pressing Escape.

    This is the default mode in MyPaint.

    # to quit out of a slowly/laggily rendering stroke if desired.

    # Due to later versions of GTK3 (3.8+) discarding successive motion
    # events received in the same frame (so-called "motion
    # compression"), we employ a GDK event filter (on platforms using
    # Xi2) to capture coordinates faster than GDK deigns to pass them on
    # to us. Reason: we want the fidelity that GDK refuses to give us
    # currently for a fancy Wacom device delivering motion events at
    # ~200Hz: frame clock speeds are only 50 or 60 Hz.

    # values received on the clock tick-synchronized motion events GDK
    # gives us, but position them at the x and y that Xi2 gave us.
