## Build/Test/Install

MyPaint depends on its brushstroke rendering library,
[libmypaint](https://github.com/mypaint/libmypaint), as well as
its brush library [mypaint-brushes](https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint-brushes).
If you have those installed, plus MyPaint's third party dependencies,
you can try it out without installing:

    git clone https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint.git
    cd mypaint
    python setup.py demo

If the demo works, you can install

    python setup.py managed_install
    python setup.py managed_uninstall

For more details, see the [Setup Instructions](BUILDING.md).
