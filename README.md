MyPaint
=======
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mypaint/mypaint.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mypaint/mypaint)

MyPaint is a simple drawing and painting program
that works well with Wacom-style graphics tablets.
Its main features are a highly configurable brush engine, speed,
and a fullscreen mode which allows artists to
fully immerse themselves in their work.

MyPaint is written in Python, C++, and C.
It makes use of the GTK toolkit, version 3.x.
The source is maintained using [git](http://www.git-scm.com),
primarily on Github.

Getting started
---------------

MyPaint has an associated library,
[libmypaint](https://github.com/mypaint/libmypaint),
which is distributed as a sister project on Github,
as well as an associated data package, mypaint-data.
If you fetch the application's source with `git`,
these dependencies will be fetched automatically
by the commands below as a relative
[submodule](http://www.git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Tools-Submodules).
There are several third-party dependencies too:

- scons (>= 2.1.0)
- pygobject
- gtk3 (>= 3.10)
- python (= 2.7) (OSX: python >= 2.7.4)
- swig
- numpy
- pycairo (>= 1.4)
- libpng
- lcms2
- libjson-c (>= 0.11, but the older "libjson" name at ~0.10 will work too)
- librsvg

Recommended: a pressure sensitive input device (graphic tablet)

Build and Install
-----------------

All systems differ. The basic build documentation is divided by broad
class of operating system and software distribution.

* [README\_LINUX.md (chiefly Debian-based systems)](README_LINUX.md)
* [README\_WINDOWS.md (work in progress, targeting MSYS2)](README_WINDOWS.md)
* [README\_OSX.md (macports - needs review)](README_OSX.md)
