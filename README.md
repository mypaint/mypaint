## Download
[Latest stable release.](https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint/releases/latest)

Releases and prereleases contain links to standalone packages
(and installers for full releases) for Windows, and AppImage files for Linux.

### Nightly releases
_Using alpha releases comes with its own risks.
Sometimes bugs can sneak in that causes crashes, so don't be too surprised by that.
If you come across any, please do [report those bugs][trackerlink] so they can be dealt with._

#### Linux
If you don't want to [build from source](#buildtestinstall),
the latest AppImage files can be found in a
[rolling release](https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint-appimage/releases/tag/continuous).
Just download the `.AppImage` file and make it executable.

#### Windows
The nightly installers and standalone archives can be downloaded from the
[AppVeyor CI](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/achadwick/mypaint)

Click on the link matching your architecture (32 or 64), then the tab named "Artifacts"
to get the file list. Only one of the files ending in `.exe` or `.7z` are needed.
Using the standalone archive (7z) is recommended.

### Windows Package Manager (winget)
The latest stable release is available to install via winget, the Windows Package Manager. To search for the package, run:

```
winget search MyPaint
```

and to install, run:

```
winget install --id MyPaint.MyPaint
```

_The winget package is not maintained by the dev team._


### Chocolatey (windows)
If you prefer to use the Chocolatey repository, both
[stable releases][choco_prerel] and [pre-releases][choco_stable]
can be found there.

[choco_prerel]: https://chocolatey.org/packages/mypaint/
[choco_stable]: https://chocolatey.org/packages/mypaint/1.2.1

## Build/Test/Install
MyPaint depends on its brushstroke rendering library,
[libmypaint](https://github.com/mypaint/libmypaint), as well as
its brush library [mypaint-brushes](https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint-brushes).
If you have those installed, plus MyPaint's third party dependencies,
you can try it out without installing:

    git clone https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint.git
    cd mypaint
    python setup.py demo

If the demo works, you can install

    python setup.py managed_install
    python setup.py managed_uninstall

For more details, see the [Setup Instructions](BUILDING.md).
