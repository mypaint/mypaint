## Download
[Latest stable release.](https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint/releases/latest)

Releases and prereleases contain links to standalone packages (and installers for
full releases) for Windows, and AppImage files for Linux.

### Nightly releases
_Using alpha releases comes with its own risks. Sometimes bugs can sneak in that
causes crashes, so don't be too surprised by that. If you come across any, please
do [report those bugs][trackerlink] so they can be dealt with._

#### Linux
If you don't want to build from source the latest AppImage files can be found in
a [rolling release](https://github.com/mypaint/mypaint-appimage/releases/tag/continuous).
Just download the `.AppImage` file and make it executable.

#### Windows
The nightly installers and standalone archives can be downloaded from the
[AppVeyor CI](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/achadwick/mypaint)

Click on the link matching your architecture (32 or 64), then the tab named "Artifacts"
to get the file list. Only one of the files ending in `.exe` or `.7z` are needed.
Using the standalone archive (7z) is recommended.

### Windows Package Manager (winget)
The latest stable release is available to install via winget, the Windows Package Manager. To search for the package, run:

```
winget search MyPaint
```

and to install, run:

```
winget install --id MyPaint.MyPaint
```

_The winget package is not maintained by the dev team._
